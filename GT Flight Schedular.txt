Now i want product_details page where requirements are it should display product name , markup and discount , discount should only be visible when user enters promo code and it matches with my promo code so one api endpoint for getting all the details of product that is not related to discount and markup and  with promocode and one endpoint for verifying that and bringing every possible details of product  
 
 
 
you are hitting currently at /checkout/Code for detail endpoint  so router = APIRouter()
 
@router.post('/checkout/Code')
 follow this format and give code
